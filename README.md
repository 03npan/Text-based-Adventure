# text-based-games

Groundwork for text-based games. Thanks to Phillip Johnson for providing the tutorial and code for the example adventure!

The real work begins now. I have a few ideas for some games I would like to do (some more ambitious than others) but ultimately the ideas I stick with will depend on the time I have and how feasible they are with my knowledge of Python.

Feel free to use the example adventure as a base for your own text-based games.
