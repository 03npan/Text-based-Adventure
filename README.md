# text-based-games

Thanks to Phillip Johnson for providing the tutorial and code for the example adventure! Some example code will still be added in the future. As of right now, there are several sections of code that are commented out. Most likely, these lines of code have been replaced by other lines of code that do the same thing; however, they are kept there in case someone wants to reference them.

Feel free to use the example adventure as a base for your own text-based games.

I have a few ideas for some games I would like to do (some more ambitious than others) but ultimately the ideas I stick with will depend on the time I have and how feasible they are with my knowledge of Python.

CURRENT PLANS
- Finish going through book tutorial and add any new/significantly different code (when compared to online tutorial).
- Change user input method for actions to one given in book
- Make heal() function appear only in proper scenarios.
- Begin brainstorming for games
